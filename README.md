# aca-image-captioning

Dataset:(The digits dataset provided is a part of this huge dataset)
kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols

The directories test and train contains the training and test examples for the digit classifier
Apart from test_process_image ,bottle_neck_dog_cat and dog_cat all other code samples are a 
part of digit classifier. Each code sample uses different algorithm

The data directory has sample images for training a dog vs cat cassifier
bottle_neck_dog_cat.py uses the pre-trained VGG16 model to build the classifier.
dog_cat.py uses the convolutional neural networks to build a classifier

The code for building a captioning model is inside the caption folder
